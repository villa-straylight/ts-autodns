# ts-autodns

After having some issues with Magic DNS on Tailscale I decided to setup a couple of things to make my life easier. To be clear: **Magic DNS** works just fine for most people. My needs are a bit weird so I am using this as a way to set things for my peculiar setup.  

This is an itch to scratch project and I doubt it'll be helpful for anyone else. Documentation is likely to be sparse and I am coding for my needs only. 

Honestly if I could figure out how do what I want along with Magic DNS I would do it that way. The main issue I have is that with Magic DNS enabled my internal PiHole ceases to work. This is my overly complicated workaround.

## ToDo
- [ ] Config file
- [ ] Tailscale authorization
- [ ] Generate hosts file
- [ ] Update NameCheap dynamic entries
